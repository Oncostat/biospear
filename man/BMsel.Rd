\details{
The objects \code{x}, \code{y}, \code{z} (if any) and \code{tt} (if any) are mandatory for non-simulated data sets.\cr
The \code{method} parameter specifies the approaches for model selection. Most of these selection methods are based on the lasso penalty (Tibshirani, 1996). The tuning parameter is usually chosen though the cross-validated log-likelihood criterion (cvl), except for the empirical extensions of the \code{lasso} in which additional penalties to the cvl (given with a suffix, e.g. \code{lasso-pcvl}) are used to estimate the tuning parameter. Other methods based on the lasso are also implemented such as the adaptive lasso (\code{alassoL}, \code{alassoR} and \code{alassoU} for which the last letter indicates the procedure used to estimate the preliminary weights: "\code{L}" for lasso, "\code{R}" for ridge and "\code{U}" for univariate), the elastic-net (\code{enet}) or the stability selection (\code{stabSel}). For the interaction setting, specific methods were implemented: to reduce/control the main effects matrix (i.e. ridge (\code{ridgelasso}) or dimension reduction (\code{PCAlasso} or \code{PLSlasso})), to select or discard main effects and interactions simultaneously (i.e. group-lasso (\code{glasso})), or to include only the interaction part in the model (i.e. \code{modCov}). Some selection methods not based on penalized regression are also proposed: univariate selection (\code{uniFDR}), gradient boosting (\code{gboost}). The \code{ridge} penalty without selection can also be applied. 

For all methods but the \code{uniFDR}, tuning parameters are chosen by maximizing the cross-validated log-likelihood (max-cvl). For the elastic-net, the "alpha" parameter (trade-off between ridge and lasso) is investigated among a predefined grid of values (as suggested by the authors, Zou et al. 2005) and the "lambda" is estimated by maximizing the above-mentioned cvl criterion for each of the "alpha" parameter. The combination (alpha; lambda) that maximizes the cvl is finally retained. For the gradient boosting, the number of steps is also estimated by the max-cvl. For the univariate selection, the tuning parameter is the FDR threshold defined by the user to control for multiple testing (using the parameter \code{uni.fdr}).

We have included the possibility to adjust for clinical covariates (\code{z}) for all methods. For penalized regressions, these covariates are considered as unpenalized. For the gradient boosting, a model with clinical covariates is preliminary implemented and regression coefficients are fixed as offset in the boosting approach. For the univariate selection, clinical covariates are forced as adjustment variables in the model and the FDR is calculated on the Wald p-values of the coefficient associated with the biomarker in such models.
